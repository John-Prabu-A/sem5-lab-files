Thread Mgmt:
------------
new(creating obj) 
-> runnable ( obj.start();) 
-> running (run method called internally by jvm after start call) 
-> blocked(wait - IO/sleep(temporarily block current thread specific period of time) /priority/suspend/yield) 
-> exit (Job finished/ abropted due to unhandled exception)


sync - while T1 running T2, T3 should wait
async - T1, T2, T3 can run same time (blocked thread, join operation, thread switching)

priority of thread (min: 0, default: 5, max: 10)


Thread Creation:
----------------
runnable (interface) need thread class to extend
super abstract static Thread (Class)
